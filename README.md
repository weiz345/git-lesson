# Git Lesson

The lesson covers the basics of version control. 

This is the part of the first lesson for Chem 280.

To make a commit (or "version" or "checkpoint") of your project, follow this procedure 

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a checkpoint if the files by using the 'git add' command and list the files.
3. Create a checkpoint using 'git commit -m "messages about what you did"'
